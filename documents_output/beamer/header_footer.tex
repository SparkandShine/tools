\section{One Day At A Time}
\subsection{Lyrics}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{One Day At A Time, Cristy Lane}
\begin{center}
I'm only human, I'm just a woman. \\
Help me believe in what I could be \\
And all that I am. \\
Show me the stairway, I have to climb. \\
Lord for my sake, teach me to take \\
One day at a time. \\

Chorus: \\
One day at a time sweet Jesus\\ 
That's all I'm asking from you. \\
Just give me the strength \\
To do everyday what I have to do. \\
Yesterday's gone sweet Jesus \\
And tomorrow may never be mine. \\
Lord help me today, show me the way \\
One day at a time. \\

Do you remember, when you walked among men? \\
Well Jesus you know if you're looking below \\
It's worse now, than then. \\
Cheating and stealing, violence and crime \\
So for my sake, teach me to take \\
One day at a time. \\
\end{center}

\section{Take Me to Church}
\subsection{Lyrics}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Take Me to Church}
\begin{center}
My lover's got humour \\
She's the giggle at a funeral \\
Knows everybody's disapproval \\
I should've worshipped her sooner \\
If the Heavens ever did speak \\
She is the last true mouthpiece \\
Every Sunday's getting more bleak \\
A fresh poison each week \\
'We were born sick, ' you heard them say it \\
My church offers no absolutes \\
She tells me 'worship in the bedroom' \\
The only heaven I'll be sent to \\
Is when I'm alone with you \\
I was born sick, but I love it \\
Command me to be well \\
Amen. Amen. Amen \\
Take me to church \\
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies \\
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife \\
Offer me that deathless death \\
Good God, let me give you my life  \\
Take me to church  \\
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies  \\
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife  \\
Offer me that deathless death  \\
Good God, let me give you my life  \\
If I'm a pagan of the good times  \\
My lover's the sunlight  \\
To keep the Goddess on my side  \\
She demands a sacrifice \\
To drain the whole sea \\
Get something shiny \\
Something meaty for the main course \\
That's a fine looking high horse \\
What you got in the stable? \\
We've a lot of starving faithful \\
That looks tasty \\
That looks plenty \\
This is hungry work \\
Take me to church \\
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies \\
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife \\
Offer me that deathless death \\
Good God, let me give you my life \\
Take me to church \\
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies \\
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife \\
Offer me that deathless death \\
Good God, let me give you my life \\
No masters or kings when the ritual begins \\
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin \\
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene \\
Only then I am human \\
Only then I am clean \\
Amen. Amen. Amen \\
Take me to church \\
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies \\
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife \\
Offer me that deathless death \\
Good God, let me give you my life \\
Take me to church \\
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies \\
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife \\
Offer me that deathless death \\
Good God, let me give you my life
